The plugin adds a title and a rel="nofollow" checkbox to the insert link popup box.

== Description ==

The plugin restores the `Title` field (that was removed from WordPress 4.2) in the insert link popup box and adds a new `Add rel="nofollow" to link` checkbox to it. 

The plugin is based on two other plugins, [Restore Link Title Field](https://wordpress.org/plugins/restore-link-title-field/) and [WPRes - nofollow link](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpres-nofollow-link/), so kudos to their authors!
